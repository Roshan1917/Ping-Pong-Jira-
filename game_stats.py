## Session Statistics
- Player 1 Score: {stats['player1_score']}
- Player 2 Score: {stats['player2_score']}
- Games Played: {stats['games_played']}
- Session Duration: {stats['session_duration']}
- Timestamp: {stats['timestamp']}

## Game Performance Analysis
- Winner: {'Player 1' if stats['player1_score'] > stats['player2_score'] else 'Player 2' if stats['player2_score'] > stats['player1_score'] else 'Tie'}
- Total Points Scored: {stats['player1_score'] + stats['player2_score']}
- Average Score per Player: {(stats['player1_score'] + stats['player2_score']) / 2:.1f}

## Session Summary
This gaming session was automatically recorded from the Pong game.
Session data can be used for performance tracking and game improvement analysis.
