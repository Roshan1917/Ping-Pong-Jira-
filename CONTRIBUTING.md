## 📋 Code Guidelines

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add docstrings for classes and functions

### Game Development
- Maintain 60 FPS performance
- Keep game logic separate from rendering
- Use object-oriented design principles
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### Example Code Style
```python
class GameEntity:
    """Base class for game objects."""
    
    def __init__(self, x: int, y: int):
        """Initialize game entity at given position."""
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def update(self) -> None:
        """Update entity state - override in subclasses."""
        pass
    
    def draw(self, screen) -> None:
        """Draw entity on screen - override in subclasses."""
        pass
```
